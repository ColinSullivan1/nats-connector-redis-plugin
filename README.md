## Summary

The NATS connector is provided to facilitate the bridging of NATS and other technologies with a general, easy to use, plug-in framework.  General application tasks and NATS connectivity are taken care of, allowing a developer to focus on the technology rather than application development.  The java platform was chosen to reach most existing technologies today.

Some plug-ins will be provided and maintained by Apcera.

## Installation

### Maven Central

#### Releases

The NATS connector is currently alpha and there are no official releases.

#### Snapshots

Snapshots are regularly uploaded to the Sonatype OSSRH (OSS Repository Hosting) using
the same Maven coordinates.
Add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml`.

```xml
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.nats</groupId>
      <artifactId>nats-connector-redis-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```
If you don't already have your pom.xml configured for using Maven snapshots, you'll also need to add the following repository to your pom.xml.

```xml
<repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
        <id>sonatype-snapshots</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
#### Building from source code (this repository)
First, download the source code:
```
git clone git@github.com:nats-io/nats-connector-redis-plugin.git .
```

To build the library, use [maven](https://maven.apache.org/). From the root directory of the project:

```
mvn package verify
```
The jar file will be built in the `target` directory. Then copy the jar file to your classpath and you're all set.

NOTE: running the unit tests requires that `gnatsd` be installed on your system and available in your executable search path.  For the NATS redis plugin to pass tests, the redis server must be installed and running at the default port.

## NATS connector Redis plug-in source package structure

* io.nats.connector.plugins.redis - This redis plug-in, developed by Apcera.


### Redis plugin

The redis plug-in is:
```
com.io.nats.connector.plugins.redis.RedisPubSubPlugin
```

#### Configuration

The NATS Redis plugin is configured by specifying a url that returns JSON file as a system property.  In this example, 
the url specifies a local file.  It can be any location that meets the URI standard.

```
-Dnats.io.connector.plugins.redispubsub.configurl="file:///Users/colinsullivan/redis_nats_connector.json"
```
in code:
```
System.setProperty(RedisPubSubPlugin.CONFIG_URL, "file:///Users/colinsullivan/redis_nats_connector.json");
```

The Redis Pub/Sub plugin configuration file read at the URI must have the following format:

```
{
    "host" : "localhost",
    "port" : 6379,
    "timeout" : 2000,
    "nats_to_redis_map" : [
        {
            "subject" : "Export.Redis",
            "channel" : "Import_NATS"
        }
    ],
    "redis_to_nats_map" : [
        {
            "channel" : "Export_NATS",
            "subject" : "Import.Redis",
        }
    ]
}

```

* Host is the redis cluster host.
* Port is the redis port.
* Timeout is the Redis timeout.

The nats_to_redis_map array is a list of NATS subjects mapped to Redis channels.  NATS wildcarding is supported.  
So, in this case, any messages published to Export.Redis in the NATS cluster will be received, and published onto
the Redis Channel "Import_NATS".

From the other direction, any message published from redis on the Export_NATS channel, will be published into
the NATS cluster on the Import.Redis subject.  At least one map needs to be defined.

Wildcarding and pattern matching is not supported at this time.

Circular message routes generated by overlapping maps should be avoided.

Basic circular route detection is performed, but is not considered a fatal error and plugin will operate.
